The main graph is will have overall_score plotted.there will be a threshold .value below threshold will be categorized as dropout,value on the threshold line will be categorized  as averag and value much above the threshold will be categorized as excellent.The graph will depict the current scenario based on the marks and also it will show the prediction graph(That is the line in graph) which would show that whether the student will dropout,or be average or be excellent based on the current stats.
This graph will be visible to students and teachers.

Hardcore:-Static (create columns) the values avg_cca,avg_lca in the original dataset ie updated

preprocess this uodated dataset and get important features(avg_cca,avg_lca,overall_score)
train the model on the cleaned dataset(given by preprocess)

Refer line 48 in preprocess
